This is the legacy Zulip iOS app; it is no longer in the app store and
is no longer developed.  You probably are looking for the
[Zulip React Native app](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile), which
is actively developed.

This project remains primarily for historical interest.

----------

The following steps are needed to build and run this project:

```
git submodule init
git submodule --recursive update
pod install

open Zulip.xcodeproj/
```
